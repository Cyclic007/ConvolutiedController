#### May 26 The Start

I decided to make a controller that both doesn't have stick drift but also is wireless

The controller will use Hall effect joysticks

also started the scematic and learned I am a fool and that - goes to grd and not +

** Total time spent 3hr **

#### May 29 Short bit

I am going to fix the PCB and all that stuff because I kinda messed it up

I need to setup a swith for the joystick inputs because I have 3 pins and need 4 so I am going to have it constantly switch
